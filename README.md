# pet_project_Calculator

Hi, everybody! This is one of the first pet projects on my page. Of course it's a calculator! He is able to perform simple mathematical operations with integers. 
- If the answer is "undefined" - it will output "0"
- The calculator window is read-only.
In the future, I want to make it possible to move the calculator on the screen with a computer mouse.
